      Who was Sylvia Rivera?
    </h1>
    <p>
      Born and raised in America’s bustling NYC, Sylvia Rivera made a name for herself as a <span>Latina American drag queen</span> during the 60s and 70s, while also <span>advocating for the voices of minorities</span> such as the LGBTQ community, particularly <span>the transgender community</span>. As of today, she is the only trans person included in the National Portrait Gallery at the Smithsonian.

      On July 2, 1951, in the Bronx, Rivera was born to her Puerto Rican father and Venezuelan mother. As one misfortune trailed after another, her mother committed suicide not long after her father abandoned her family, resulting in Rivera’s grandmother gaining custody of her. The relationship between these two was far from loving and nurturing; instead, Rivera was frequently <strong>beaten and brutally rejected for her effeminate behavior</strong> as she was assigned male at birth. No longer able to tolerate the abuse, Rivera fled her grandmother’s home and resorted to becoming a child prostitute working mainly around Time Square. Rivera was on her path to later <strong>encountering a group of drag queens</strong>  who welcomed her to their community with open arms.

        STAR: Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (1970)
      </h2>
        <p>
          One year after participating in <strong>the notable Stonewall Riots</strong> in 1969, Sylvia Rivera founded Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries with <strong>Marsha P. Johnson</strong>, a close friend, and Black drag queen. The creation of this association was due to the constant <strong>discrimination</strong> the trans community faced during the gay rights movement. The transgender community not only faced exclusion from The Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act in New York but also was met with <strong>exclusion from the Gay Activist Alliance (GAA)</strong>, an organization that was created in response to Stonewall. The intersectionality of such discrimination was prominent, as the majority of the trans population were people of color.

        SRLP: The Sylvia Rivera Law Project (2002)
      </h2>
        <p>
          One of her last accomplishments–yet the one with the most long-lasting effect–was founding the Sylvia Rivera Law Project. She established this project in hopes that it would provide <strong>adequate access to legal services</strong> to those of marginalized communities. This project aimed to allow everyone the <strong>liberty</strong> to identify however they please–the SRLP would not deny anyone regarding their sexuality, gender, race, or income level. Alongside providing legal services, the SRLP worked with the public to <strong>teach leadership and advocacy skills</strong>. The SRLP continues to live today to ensure that trans, genderfluid, and gender nonconforming people can live a <strong>life of security and stability</strong>.
